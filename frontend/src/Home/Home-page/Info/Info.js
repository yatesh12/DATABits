        <h2>What is Data Preprocessing?</h2>
        <p>
          Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data analysis and machine learning process. It involves transforming raw data into a clean and usable format. This step is essential because real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and lacking in certain behaviors or trends that are important for accurate analysis.

        <h2>Why is Data Preprocessing Important?</h2>
        <p>
          Properly preprocessed data can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models. Here are some key reasons why data preprocessing is important:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Improves Data Quality:</b> Helps in dealing with missing values, noise, and inconsistencies.</li>
          <li><b>Enhances Model Performance:</b> Clean and well-structured data leads to more accurate and reliable models.</li>
          <li><b>Reduces Complexity:</b> Simplifies the data, making it easier to understand and interpret.</li>
          <li><b>Enables Better Feature Engineering:</b> Facilitates the creation of more meaningful features for the model.</li>
