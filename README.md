### DATABits — Data Preprocessing Platform

A data preprocessing toolkit that accelerates ETL and ML data preparation with AI-driven profiling, quality scoring, and reusable transformation building blocks. Built for data scientists and engineers who want clean, auditable datasets fast.

Badges  
- **Status:** Production ready  
- **Language:** TypeScript, Python  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask + Python ML ecosystem  
- **Repository:** https://github.com/yatesh12/DataBits

### Key Features

- **Workflow Acceleration** — Cut standard data preprocessing time by up to **40%** with reusable pipelines and automated steps.  
- **AI Powered Data Profiling** — Automatic scans that surface distributions, correlations, missingness, and anomalies with clear visual summaries.  
- **Comprehensive Data Quality Score** — Single-number data-quality metric plus granular diagnostics for completeness, consistency, accuracy, and validity.  
- **Interactive Visual Summaries** — Quick charts and pivot views for exploratory analysis and fast decision making.  
- **Composable Transformations** — Build and reuse cleaning steps, imputations, encodings, and feature engineering blocks.  
- **Extensible Backend** — Flask service layer with modular Python components ready to integrate custom ML or data validation logic.

### Technology Stack

- Frontend: **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**  
- Backend: **Flask**, **Python**, common ML libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)  
- Data formats: CSV, Parquet, JSON, and streaming-friendly adapters  
- Deployment: Container friendly, CI/CD ready

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/yatesh12/DATABits-Workplace.git

2. Frontend setup  
   cd DataBits/frontend  
   npm install  
   npm run dev

3. Backend setup  
   cd ../backend  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate   # use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   flask run

4. Open the frontend in your browser at http://localhost:3000 and connect to the backend at the configured API endpoint.

### Usage Summary

- Upload a dataset or connect a data source.  
- Run an AI data profile to generate visual summaries and a data-quality score.  
- Inspect automated suggestions for cleaning and transformation.  
- Apply transformations interactively or export a pipeline for reproducible execution.  
- Export cleaned datasets in CSV or Parquet for downstream modeling.

---

### Project Structure

- frontend — React app, UI components, and dashboards.  
- backend — Flask API, data validation modules, profiling engines.  
- docs — User guides, API reference, and architecture diagrams.  
- examples — Sample datasets and reproducible pipeline examples.  
- tests — Unit and integration tests for frontend and backend.

---

### Architecture Overview

- Lightweight frontend communicates with Flask API over RESTful endpoints.  
- Profiling engine runs asynchronously on the backend and returns: visual metrics, anomaly lists, and a composite quality score.  
- Transformation pipelines are represented as serializable recipes for replay and CI integration.  
- Designed for horizontal scaling via container orchestration.

### Contribution Guidelines

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch prefixed by feature/issue/bugfix.  
- Write tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass.  
- Keep commits atomic and messages descriptive.  
- Open a pull request with a concise description and testing steps.  
- Follow the project coding style and linting rules for both frontend and backend.

---

### Roadmap

- Add automated dataset drift detection and versioned profiles.  
- Integrate a scheduler to run profiles and pipelines on a cadence.  
- Add more export targets and connectors (databases, data lakes, cloud storage).  
- Provide a visual pipeline editor for nontechnical users.
